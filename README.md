# Kaiser
File-less persistence, attacks and anti-forensic capabilities (Windows 7 32-bit).

**NOTE**: This project was **NOT** designed to evade AV detection.

**This project is discontinued.**

## How to Build/Use:

1. Compile _Kaiser.dll_ in Release mode
2. Upload _Kaiser.dll_ such that it can be directly downloaded as a raw binary
3. Update the _BuildKaiser.ps1_ script to include the URL for _Kaiser.dll_
4. Run _BuildKaiser.ps1_ to build the _Payload.ps1_ script
5. Upload the _Payload.ps1_ script such that it can be directly downloaded as raw text
6. Update the _BuildKaiser.ps1_ script to include the URL of _Payload.ps1_
7. Run _BuildKaiser.ps1_ to build the _Installer.ps1_ script
8. Run the _Installer.ps1_ script with administrative privileges on the target machine

## Known bugs:

* Threaded `XxxNetSend` sends will buffer - probably will be solved with some setsockopt magic
* `PurgeXxx` functions are not guaranteed to work (perhaps this is because it uses `ShellExecuteEx`
* More?

## TODO

* `CommandPrintStatus` to print the status of Kaiser?
* Convert functions in `firewall.c` to WinAPI
* [OPTIONAL] Make C2 connection loop until established
*  Convert Functions in `registry.c` to WinAPI
* Send debugging warnings/errors back to C2
* Make `PurgeProcessMonitor` asynchronous (`IWbemServices::ExecNotificationQueryAsync`)
